Hi there. I'm a musicology PhD turned tech executive. This site is a work in progress, a personal project to sharpen a few skills. It is often at least a little awkward.

I work at the intersections of technology, the arts and humanities, and the public good. I'm trying to change the future of music streaming, for the better. I'm also a music historian who studies gender, race, music, and technology in the US.
