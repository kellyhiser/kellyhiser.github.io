Hi there. I'm a musicology PhD turned tech executive.

In my day job, I work at the intersections of technology, the arts and humanities, and the public good. I moonlight as a historian, where my work focuses on gender, race, music, and technology.

I'm available on a limited basis as a consultant and editor for good people and meaningful projects.





## Upcoming talks:

The Association for Computers and the Humanities 2019 Conference, Pittsburgh, July 25 "Building a Digital Public Space with (not for) Pittsburgh's Music Communities"

Abstractions, Pittsburgh, details coming soon...
