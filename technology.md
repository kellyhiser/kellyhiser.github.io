### Rabble & MUSICat

I'm CEO and co-founder of [Rabble](https://musicat.co/rabble), a startup dedicated to empowering libraries to support and sustain their local creative communities. We build the open source platform [MUSICat](https://musicat.co/) that libraries use to collect, curate, license, and publish local music collections.

At Rabble I:
- direct the development of MUSICat internally and with our library partners
- oversee hiring and management of our team
- coordinate support for our library partners and their communities
- write code, manage our team's GitHub repos, project manage DNS
- lead Rabble's day to day finances, marketing, and sales
