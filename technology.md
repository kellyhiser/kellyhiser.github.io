I'm co-founder and CEO of [Rabble](https://musicat.co/rabble), a startup dedicated to empowering libraries to support and sustain their local creative communities. We build a the open source platform [MUSICat](https://musicat.co/).

### I regularly speak and write about my work. Some samples:

Keynote, [Social Good Summit](https://socialgoodmadison.org/), Madison, WI, 2018.

I blogged about my work with libraries and creative communities for the Library as Incubator Project from 2014 - 2017. You can find those posts archived [here](http://www.libraryasincubatorproject.org/?tag=kelly-hiser).
