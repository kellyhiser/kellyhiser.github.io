## Projects I'm involved in, causes I believe in.

[Prototype](https://prototypepgh.com/) is a feminist makerspace in Pittsburgh, PA. I'm part of their incubator, [Women's Work](https://prototypepgh.com/incubator).

I'm currently on the website committee for the [Code4Lib](https://2020.code4lib.org/) 2020 [conference](https://2020.code4lib.org/) in Pittsburgh.

I donate (and encourage others to donate) to:
- [RAICES](https://www.raicestexas.org/) or another organization getting people free at the border.
- [New Voices Pittsburgh](http://www.newvoicespittsburgh.org/), a reproductive justice org that promotes the health and well-being of black women and girls.

If you're a tech organization, please consider offering childcare at your events. Check out organizations like [Flexible](http://flexablecare.com/) that specialize in workplace and event childcare.
