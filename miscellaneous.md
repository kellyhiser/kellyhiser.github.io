## Projects I'm involved in, causes I believe in.

[Prototype](https://prototypepgh.com/) is a feminist makerspace in Pittsburgh, PA. I'm part of their incubator, [Women's Work](https://prototypepgh.com/incubator).

Please consider donating to [RAICES](https://www.raicestexas.org/) or another organization getting people free at the border.

If you're a tech organization, please consider offering childcare at your events. Check out organizations like [Flexible](http://flexablecare.com/) that specialize in worlplace and event childcare.
